## Project Overview

This project enables you to receive email notifications whenever the International Space Station (ISS) passes overhead at your location. By setting up this script, you'll stay informed about the ISS's visibility from your own vantage point in the sky.

### Setup Instructions

To ensure the code functions correctly, please follow these steps:

1. **Email and Password Configuration**: 
   - Update the script with your email address and password in the designated sections. This information is necessary for sending email notifications.

2. **Location Coordinates**: 
   - Modify the script to include the geographic coordinates of your location. This will allow the script to accurately determine when the ISS is passing over your area.

3. **Cloud Deployment**:
   - For continuous operation of the script, consider uploading it to a Python cloud platform. This will ensure that the script runs persistently and you receive timely notifications.

### Interactive Features

Once configured, the script will automatically monitor the ISSâ€™s trajectory and send you an email alert when it is visible from your location. This feature is designed to keep you engaged with real-time events in space.

Should you have any questions or need assistance with the setup, please feel free to reach out.
